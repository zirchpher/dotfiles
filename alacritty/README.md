## ⚡ About

This is my basic configuration of my **Alacritty terminal**.

Since the file can grow, or also that I like to test things,
I want to have a backup version which if it works correctly

```bash
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.yml

$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty.yml

$HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml

$HOME/.alacritty.yml
```

### 🐧 Linux

Clone the repository inside some folder like `~/Downloads`
Or whichever is your preference

And copy the file inside the folder

```bash
~/.config/alacritty/<copy here>
```

### 💻 Windows

The same way just clone the repository don't download the **.zip** file and copy or cut the **.yml** file into the following path
On **Windows**, the config file should be located at:

```bash
%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.yml
```
